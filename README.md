# LIST

  Mostly, I will easily forget the List operators from standard libarary. Thus, I shall create my own library,
that will easily read for me.

  However, to construct a convenient libarary need at least one "STANDARD". Therefore, this section is full of
standards and operations.

INCLUDING:

  Standards:
  
    Numerical List Standard(NLS) 
    
    Binary List Standard(BLS) 
    
    Numerical Function Standard(NFS)
